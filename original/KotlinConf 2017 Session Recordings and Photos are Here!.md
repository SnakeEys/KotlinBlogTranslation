About KotlinConf 2017
The first-ever KotlinConf took place November 2-3, 2017, at Pier 27 in San Francisco, California. The conference featured 50 speakers presenting 45 talks across 3 tracks. More than 1,200 passionate attendees from 46 countries participated at KotlinConf. None of this would have been possible without our 17 event partners.
Thanks to all who took part, we hope to meet many more of you at future events!
