Kotlin for Java Developers Workshop
This workshop will cover all the Kotlin features you need to know to feel comfortable with the language as well as look “under the hood” and discuss cornerstones of Java interoperability where necessary. You’ll get everything you need to know to start working with Kotlin immediately. The workshop will cover, amongst other things

* Basic syntax
* Nullability
* Object-oriented programming with Kotlin
* Functional programming with Kotlin
* Java interoperability
* Building DSLs

Svetlana Isakova has worked on the Kotlin language at JetBrains. She’s co-authored the book Kotlin in Action and now is a Developer Advocate, where she spends her time teaching Kotlin and speaking at conferences worldwide.
Building Libraries for Kotlin
Kotlin has a lot of great features that improve developer productivity and make the overall code base more stable. This all works great when you’re entire code base is written in Kotlin. However, while Kotlin adoption is growing by leaps and bounds, the fact is that many applications and libraries are still on Java and will be for some time. This means, if you’re a library provider like Realm that 100k+ developers rely on, you must provide an API that works well for both platforms.
In this talk, you’ll learn about some of the challenges faced and approaches taken by Realm to solve this problem and how you might apply these same approaches to your own libraries. You’ll also learn about some of the key Kotlin features they used to simplify Realm Mobile Database development with Kotlin.
