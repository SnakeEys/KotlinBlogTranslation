We’ve just pushed major updates to a new repository we created that contains material for a Kotlin Workshop. In addition to code samples covering all major Kotlin topics, it has presentation slides, as well as exercises and questions for students to complete.
This is material that myself and others at JetBrains are using for Kotlin workshops that we’re delivering. It is divided up into Introduction and Advanced and usually pans across two days. We’ve licensed it under Creative Commons and you are welcome to use it for yourselves to learn Kotlin and/or deliver your own workshop. And of course, being open source, contributions are more than welcome!
