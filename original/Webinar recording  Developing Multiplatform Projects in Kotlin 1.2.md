A flagship feature of Kotlin 1.2 is building multiplatform projects. A multiplatform project allows you to reuse your business logic code, written in Kotlin, between all tiers of an application – the server code running under the JVM, the browser running JavaScript, as well as mobile apps. The shared portion of the code is compiled to all platforms and may delegate to platform-specific implementations of certain APIs or libraries. The platform-specific parts are also written in Kotlin and have full access to the features of each of the supported platforms.
In this talk, we’ll look at the language and IDE features that enable multiplatform development in Kotlin, as well as libraries that can be used in multiplatform code. We’ll study an example project that demonstrates isomorphic HTML rendering (reusing the rendering code between the frontend and the backend), as well as other features of Kotlin multiplatform development.
