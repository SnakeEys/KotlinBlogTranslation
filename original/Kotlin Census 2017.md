Hello!
Every year we run the Kotlin Census survey so we can get the latest feedback from you, and how you are using Kotlin in your projects. If you still don’t use Kotlin, we would like to understand your reasons why and your opinion of the language is exceptionally important for us as well. If you filled out the survey last year, thank you, it would be really helpful if you could please do it again: we’re interested in the up-to-date information, we’ve also added a few new questions and response options based on last year’s results.
As such, we’re asking you if you could kindly give us two minutes of your time and fill out the following survey.
Please note that by providing us with your details, you are not automatically giving us consent to use your name, application or company name. We would always ask for written confirmation from you before doing so.

{% raw %}
<p><span id="more-5359"></span></p>
{% endraw %}

Thank you!
