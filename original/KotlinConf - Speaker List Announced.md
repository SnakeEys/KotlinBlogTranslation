Early Bird tickets have followed the lead of Super Early Bird registration, and have sold out. Regular admission tickets are available while supplies last. If you’re considering attending KotlinConf, wait no longer to register or you might miss out.
As a reminder, KotlinConf will be held November 2-3 in beautiful San Francisco, California, at Pier 27. JetBrains team members and passionate community speakers will share their knowledge, experience and philosophy around Kotlin in a wonderful setting.
Two days of learning, networking and fun await you. Register today and reserve your seat!
We look forward to meeting you in San Francisco this fall!
